HAR Analyzer
---

HAR Analyzer is a utility/app that allows for easy visualization of HTTP Archive (HAR) Files.
I typically do backend coding so the front end is a bit rusty and does not looks as clean as I would like.


## Using

### Web

I am working on hosting this application so to allow for easier access.


### Docker

There is a docker image to run this locally. You do need a redis instance as it is used for security purposes. Check out the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file for an example of running that way.
